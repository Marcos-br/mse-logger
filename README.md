**mse_logger**

This code defines a decorator function called mse_logger that can be used to log function inputs, outputs, and errors.

**What it does**

mse_logger takes in a function func as input. It returns a wrapper function that wraps the original function.

When the wrapper function is called, it:

Generates a unique ID
Logs the function name, arguments, and keywords arguments as the function input
Calls the original function func
Saves the result as the output, and logs it
If an exception occurs, it extracts the traceback to log details about the error including the file, line number, function name, and code line where it occurred

**Purpose**

The purpose of this decorator is to automatically log inputs, outputs, and errors every time the decorated function is called.

It saves these logs to a rotating file handler defined earlier in the code.

This allows easy debugging and tracking of function executions without having to manually add logging to every function. The decorator handles inserting the logging automatically.

**Usage**

All the user has to do is decorate the functions they want to log:
```python
@mse_logger
def my_function():
```
The mse_logger decorator will then take care of logging each time my_function() is called.

**Summary**

In summary, mse_logger is a decorator that adds input/output logging and error handling to any function, achieved by wrapping the calls in a logging layer. This is useful for debugging and auditing purposes.
